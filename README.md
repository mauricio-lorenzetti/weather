Swift 5.1+

No external code required

The development process, once that the specifications are very clear, was very straightforward. By leveraging the latest Swift improvements the main 
functionality of the app was ready with very little code and consequently, time spent, leaving space for deep analysis of enhancements, error handling 
and test developing, assuring that the final product was robust and, although simple, could handle all possible cenarios, including all type of errors, 
from networking to resource parsing and displaying, and even the demand to scale the solution and include more features on it.
These principles are present throughout the code and the early adoption of techniques that enable fast scalability are know to have great positive impact 
on long term projects, reducing the time spent on development of new features and maintenance of the evergrowing present ones.
